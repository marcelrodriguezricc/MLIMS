After cloning the repository:

1. The "python" directory will require a virtual Python environment to run Python scripts. PyTorch needs to be installed in the virtual environment by running: "pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio".

2. The "cpp" directory will require LibTorch (https://pytorch.org/) to run C++ applications. You may additionally have to install and move libomp.dylib in the "lib" subfolder. If you're on macOS, and have Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use the command "brew install libomp" to install libomp.dylib.
