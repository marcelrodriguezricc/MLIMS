# TRANSFORMS

Transforms in machine learning are used to manipulate data within a set in order to make it suitable for training. You can perform transformations before training or within the model.

Some examples of when transforms may be necessary:

- Converting strings to numeric data for storing in and operating on matrices.

    - One-hot or integer encoding.

- Normalizing numeric features.

- Resizing input data to fit the number of input nodes.

- Allowing linear models to introduce non-linearity.
