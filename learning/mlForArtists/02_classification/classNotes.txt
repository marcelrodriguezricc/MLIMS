Lesson 2 - Classification

1. What is a classifier?

    - You're building a number of categories called "classes."

        - Webcam Example: Am I in position 1, position 2, or position 3?

        - Categories are mutually exclusive.

2. Nearest Neighbor Classifier

    - One Nearest Neighbor
    
        - Finds point in dataset that is closest to current input and classifies it identically.

    - Decision Stump

        - Learns a threshold from your examples "if-then-else block."

    - K Nearest Neighbor

        - Finds distance from three closest points in dataset to current input and classifies it based on whichever class is more represented.
    
    - Decision Tree

3. Features

    - Another word for the number of dimensionality of the data.
    
        - A point in three dimensional space has three features (x, y, z).

4. Input Output Connector

    - In Wekinator, you can remove features from specified inputs from being considered in determining the output from the input-output connector menu.

    - Effects which choice of features will effect results.
