Lesson 5 - Feature Extraction

1. What are features?

    - A measurement of some phenomena represented by a number.

    - If our input is multi-dimensional, there will be a list of features for each example.

        - List of features is called a "feature vector."

            - Assumptions:
        
                - Always the same length (eg. 3 features).

                - Same order and meaning from list to list.
    
2. What is a good feature?

    - Should be relevant to the learning problem.

    - Should have as little noise as possible.

    - We don't want too many features.

    - The more features you have, the more training examples you need.

    - Curse of dimensionality.

    - Set of features should as a whole should provide enough information.

        - We would like examples that are close in feature space to be similar to each other. (eg. same  class).

            - Adding a dimension may differentiate further between classes.

3. Simple Features:

    - With some controllers you will extract features using streaming or polling approach.

        - 10 milliseconds.

    - Some controllers send an event when controls are interacted with.

    - Wekinator can handle feature selection from a menu.

    - Difference features can be used to overcome noisy inputs (rate of change, etc.)

        - In Wekinator, you may need to press record while the variable is changing to capture the examples correctly.

        - You can increase dimensionality of this as well (rate of change of rate of change, velocity to acceleration).

    - Wekinator allows you to delete training examples manually to isolate features and clean up noise.

    - There are also data sending constraints in Wekinator Input Helper, such as threshold.

4. Complicated Inputs:

    - Real-time audio and video.

    - Audio Feature Extractor

        - RMS for amplitude.

        - FFT for sinusoidal components.

            - Spectral Centroid for timbral qualities.

            - Constant Q transform gives us amplitude of peaks.

                - Variable amount of bins for octave.

                - Can be beneficial to lower number of bins for simplicity's sake

            - Chromagram sums together all bins which correspond to a certain frequency.
            
            - Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients

                - Sound qualities aside from pitch and loudness.

                    - Speech, instrumentation.

                - Used in genre classification, speech recognition.

                - Gives a vector of values (12 to 13).

                - Each coefficient is consistently similar for similar sounds.
            
            - Using several features in tandem can help with recognition of musical phenomena.

5. Recommended Tools:

    - Real-time feature Extraction

        - Maximilian (C++).

        - Marsyas (C++, Python, Max/MSP).

        - Max/MSP Analyzer~, Fiddle~.

6. Smoothing inputs

    - Averaging every n number of values.

    - Filter.

        - Wekinator has a filter equation section.

7. Computer Vision

    - OpenCV (OpenFrameworks).

    - Color tracking.

    - Fiducials (Shapes meant for computer vision)

        - Reactivision (Library for Computer Vision).

    - Haar Cascades

        - Used in face detection.

            - Darker shadows under your eyes than your cheeks, looks for bar of bright pixel over dark pixel.

        - Can be built with AdaBoost from large datasets.

    - Compare pixels from one frame to the next (rate of change).

        - Can sum these features to get lower dimensional inputs.
    
    - Optical Flow

        - Looks at two subsequent frames of video and tries to match pixels in both frames.

            - OpenFrameworks OFX Flowtools.

8. Rate of Input

    - Wekinator allows you to change rate of sent values.
