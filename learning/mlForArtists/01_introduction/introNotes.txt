Lesson 1 - Introduction

Types of algorithms for real time analysis:

    1. Regression

    2. Classification

    3. Temporal Analysis

Machine Learning Pipeline:

    1. Input

        - Controller.

        - Camera.

        - Datasets.

    2. Processing / Decision Making (Model)

        - Computer decides what action to take.

    3. Output

        - Sound synthesis, game, video, etc...

ML Algorithms:

    1. Supervised

        -   Algorithm which helps in the middle, processing / decision-making process, or the model.

        -   Builds a model from inputs and outputs, determines what the model should ultimately do.

        -   The learning algorithm takes in training data, and creates the model.

            -   When the model is given input data, it generates a corresponding output.

Drum Machine Example:

    1. Processing allows for webcam input. It reduces the dimensionality of the image for a more manageable dataset.

        - This information is then sent to Wekinator over OSC.

    2. Wekinator collects snapshots of the input information (training examples) from each state. These states are gathered and assigned to a corresponding output value.

        - The combination of different states can then be gathered into a model, and tested by changing between the states and looking for corresponding output integer.

        - The corresponding output integer is then sent to ChucK to switch between sound states.

    3. ChucK produces the drum machine sounds based on the input integer from Wekinator.

Wekinator:

    - A program for real-time machine learning.

    - Uses OSC as communication protocol.
