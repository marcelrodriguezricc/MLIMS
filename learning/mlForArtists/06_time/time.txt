Lesson 6 - Working with time

What if we would like our model to recognize patterns over time?

1. With Wekinator...

    - In the Input Helper, there's an option to include an input buffer, which maintains
    a buffer of a set number of values for each input.

        - The length of the buffer can be adjusted to accommodate more samples from each input.

            - This gives us a higher dimensionality, which can make things hard to classify.

        - Buffers that are used to train the model must be the same length in order for classification and regression algorithms to properly categorize the features.

            - Downsample or upsample buffer to be the same length.
        
            - Input Helper program can specify how many time points will be stored in buffer between start and stop.

                - An extra feature can be mapped to trigger start and stop.

2. Segmentation

    - Determining when an action begin or ends.

        - Audio might use RMS to determine when an action begins or end.

        - With video, a change in movement from stationary to in motion can be used to determine.

3. Simple Approach

    - Use a physical button or simple trigger to detect when an action starts.

    - Begin collecting features and store in a buffer of predetermined size.

    - After a set period of time, or from a trigger, take the data from the buffer and classify it.

        - Upsample / downsample if needed.

    - If you don't have  physical button, a trigger can require careful tuning.

    - If there is potential for changes in how an action proceeds over time, the feature space may look different to the model.

    - Limited to classification or regression only after motion is completed.

4. Dynamic Time Warping

    - Computes similarity of two sequences of data overtime.

    - Each feature vector represents a single "snapshot" in time.

        - Must always have the same number & type of features.

    - Sequences of features don't have to be the same length.

    - Allows for the computation of similarity between similar patterns that happen at different rates.

        - For example, moving your hand in a clockwise circle quickly, or slowly.

    - This can be done in Wekinator

        - Patterns can be recorded, given a threshold of similarity, and be dedicated to a specific output.

        - It can use classification and regression models to compare similarities through a dynamic time warping based multidimensional space as opposed to two dimensional euclidean space.
        
            - It gives a distance difference between sequences.

            - Works well with nearest neighbor classifier, which also looks at distances.
