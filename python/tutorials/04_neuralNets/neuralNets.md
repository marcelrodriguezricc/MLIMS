# ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK

In machine learning, a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes that learn from data in order to solve problems and achieve tasks. They're named neural networks because their design is based loosely on the way neurons interact in the human brain. The nodes are grouped by layer, with an input, output and a varying number of hidden layers. In the feedfoward structure, information is passed from the input to each subsequent hidden layer and finally the output. The output will reorganize the data in a way which achieves the problem or task the network is meant to perform. Each node is a linear regression model, which describes the relationship between two variables. Each node has associated weights which determine the significance of it's output to the subsequent nodes. Weights are multiplied to the node's output. Baises are also applied to provide flexibility in accounting for variation. Baises are added or subtracted from the node's summed output, and serve as a threshold for whether or not the node will be activated. An activation function is applied to the output of each node to introduce non-linearity for the network and assist in complex pattern recognition, and is the final step before data is passed to the next layer. Every additional layer of nodes is involved in more abstract and complex decision making based on the transformed data from the last.
