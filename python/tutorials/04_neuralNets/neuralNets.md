# ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK

In machine learning, a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes that apply transformations to data in order to solve problems and achieve tasks. They're named aritifical neural networks because they're designed based on the way neurons interact in the human brain. The nodes are grouped by layer, with an input, output and a varying number of hidden layers. In the feedfoward structure, information is passed from the input to each subsequent hidden layer and finally the output. The output will reorganize the data in a way which achieves the problem or task the network is meant to perform. Each node is a linear regression model, which describes the relationship between two variables. Each node has associated weights which determine the significance of it's output to the subsequent nodes. Baises are also applied to provide flexibility in accounting for variation. An activation function is applied to the output of each node to introduce non-linearity for the network and assist in complex pattern recognition. The activation function ultimately determines whether the neuron should be activated to pass data or not.
